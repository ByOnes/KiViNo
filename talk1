# This is an example file for KiViNo (Kivy Visual Novel Engine)
# It contains many explanations an examples on how to write your own scripts
# Currently its possible to have two characters speaking, with sound and background images and stuff
# characters can only have one image, this will change soon

# <- This is a comment
# a line always starts with a keyword, followed by some arguments

# KEYWORDS:
# character -> creates a new character
# music -> path to music that is played, does loop, set again changes the music (file must be .ogg)
# background -> name and path to background image (file should be .png)
# sound -> path to sound effect that should be played, only played once

# character_left -> creates a new character with name, path to an image on the left, existing character will be removed
# character_right -> like left, only on the right side
# remove -> removes character on the left or right
# text -> show text in the textbox, without highlighting a character
# centertext -> show text in the middle
# $charactername$ -> just enter a character name an his text, the character has to be on the left or the right
# set_background
# play_music
# play_sound
# end -> end this act, scene or chapter. removes all entities


# Example script:
# Conversation between a fish and a janitor about all the rubbish

# Initialisation: Load all the need resources for this scenario
# It is not needed to load them now, but its easier to maintain
# And when everything is loaded before, you eliminate potential hiccups at runtime
# Just think of a drama where all people are introduced in the beginning
